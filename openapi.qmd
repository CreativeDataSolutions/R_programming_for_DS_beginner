There is a lot of hype around tools like `chatGPT` which is a class of `large language models` (`LLM's`) for using`natural language` inputs to answer questions, including how to write code.

## Install chatGPT `Rstudio add in`

### Prerequisites

-   Make an [OpenAI](http://chat.openai.com/) account.
-   Create an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) to use with the package.
-   Set the API key up in Rstudio

```{r}
# install.packages(c("gptstudio","waiter"))
# library(gptstudio)
```

Try to ask the `openAI` `LLM` how it would code up some of the examples you have seen so far. Try running the code, giving feedback about any errors to the `chatbot` and see if you can customize and/or improve the code you have seen so far.
